# Testing

Testing was conducted manually and through different validator services on each page of the website.

<a id="validators"></a>
## Validators

* [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) was used on each page to ensure 
that there were no errors or warning in my HTML document. I have a few errors and warnings display as per the below screenshot:

![W3C HTML Validation Results1](/static/images/testing-images/w3c/warning1.jpg)

* This warning is to do with not having headers in the correct place. This has been ignored as the area it is referring to 
doesn't have headings.

![W3C HTML Validation Results2](/static/images/testing-images/w3c/errors_warnings.jpg)

* The error and warnings that display are due to being able to decrease the quantity value in the shopping bag.  
Unfortunately due to time restraints I haven't been able to fix this. This will be fixed after completing the course.

![W3C HTMl Validation Results3](/static/images/testing-images/w3c/error.jpg)

* This error I have found very confusing. I don't understand how to fix it, even after researching it on Stack Overflow. 
Unfortunately due to time restraints this error will get looked into more closely after I have completed the course.

*[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) was used to ensure that there were no errors or warnings in my CSS document and validated by direct input. I had no errors or warning display.

![W3C CSS Validation Results](/static/images/testing-images/w3c/css-validation-results.jpg)

* [Autoprefixer CSS Online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) was used to ensure that all vendor prefixes 
were included in CSS. the results were copied into the style.css file.

* [Pep8](http://pep8online.com/) was used to check every .py file. No errors or warnings displayed.
