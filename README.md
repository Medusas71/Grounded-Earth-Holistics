# Description  

I am currently studying the Full Stack Development Course through Code Institute. Part of the course I am required to complete 4 milestone projects. Grounded Earth Holistics is my 4th milestone project which is part of the Full Stack Frameworks with Django.

Grounded Earth Holistics is an e-commerce site that has been created for customers that would like a holistic experience. This experience includes a deeply relaxing session with either Tuning Forks or healing crystals. Customers can purchase various products through a secure checkout.

Some of the content and images have been copied from Grounded Earth Holistics with their permission.
