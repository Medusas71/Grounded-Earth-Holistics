# Description  

I am currently studying the Full Stack Development Course through Code Institute. Part of the course I am required to complete 4 milestone projects. Grounded Earth Holistics is my 4th milestone project which is part of the Full Stack Frameworks with Django.

Grounded Earth Holistics has been created for customers that would like a holistic experience. This experience includes a deeply relaxing session with either Tuning Forks or healing crystals.
